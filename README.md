# Movie-Recommender-System

In this project I build a recommendation system to predict a userâ€™s preference in movie choice most effectively. I use MovieLens metadata to create a recommender that can work off of user behavior and movie characteristics to produce suggestions relevant to the user. The data set for Project 2 comes from the Grouplens organization which pulled data stemming from the movie recommendation system MovieLens.

The data set was originally obtained from the URL: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/. This group out of the University of Minnesota specializes in recommender systems and other online computing systems and researches their use and abilities. The data set contains rating and tagging activity from MovieLens, and consists of 105,339 ratings and 6,138 tagging applications across 10,329 movies. Users are represented simply by an ID without any other demographic detail. All users had rated at least 20 movies to be selected.
